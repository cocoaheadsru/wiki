# Code Style

These guidelines applied to **all** CocoaHeads Russia projects.

## Xcode and Swift Style Guidelines

**We follow [these guidelines](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) in coding**

* Don't use acronyms and abbreviations
* Use indentation == 2 in for *Tab width* and *Indent width*. In most cases it will already be applied in project `.xcodeproj` file or will applied in project setup by first run script.

**Xcode → Preferences → Text Editing → Indentation**

## Coding

### iOS/macOS

**Naming**

- Controller
  - Controller classes musn't have application logic and can only be used for classes intercation
- Protocols
  - Protocols that describe what something is should read as nouns **(e.g.** `Collection`**)**.
  - Protocols that describe a capability should be named using the suffixes *-able*, *-ible*, or *-ing* **(e.g.** `Equatable`**,** `ProgressReporting`**)**.
- Extensions
  - Extensions must be named as follow: `<Capitalized type name>+<Capitalized component name>` **(e.g.** `String+Localization`**)**.
  - Extensions must be placed in proper folders: `extensions/<Capitalized framework name>/<Capitalized type name>/<Extension File>` **(e.g. extensions/Foundation/String/String+Localization.swift)**
	  
**Project structure must match file structure**

**Fonts & Colors**

- Fonts must be assigned through `enum UIFont.FontType` **(e.g.** `UIFont.appFont(.gothamProMedium(size: 14))`**)**
- The same with colors: `enum UIColor.ColorType` **(e.g.** `UIColor(.grey)`**)**
